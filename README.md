# StockMarket LSTM Model

This project implements an LSTM neural network to predict stock market prices.

The LSTM model is trained on historical stock data and uses technical indicators as features.

# Overview

The aim of this project is to demonstrate, through practical application, the essential skills required for a data science project. This was achieved by following a six-stage structure:

### 1. Data Collection
The data is collected from a CSV file taken from this article about LSTM Models. It contains the stockmarket prices of the company Apple for everyday of the period 2006-01-01 to 2018-01-01

2- Building Data Pipeline (Data Cleaning/Data Wrangling)
3- Data Exploration
4- Data Visualization
5- Model Building
6- Model in Production

<!-- (Explain the key concepts and technologies involved in the project.) -->

__Key Concepts:__
- LSTM: Long Short Term Memory networks are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn long sequences of inputs.

__Technologies:__
- __Python__: most used language for Data Science programming because it has many useful libraries for data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization.
- __TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn__
- __Streamlit__: A Python library to build web apps from your existing Python code.
